I told the waiter and when he told his manager about it, she literally ignored it and shooed him away. I am very disappointed in the customer service, seeing as if I was a health inspector, the place would have been shut down immediately. What I experienced could have sent me to the hospital if I had actually swallowed it. I am never ever going back there again, seeing as I want to keep my life.</td>\n",

The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself, brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. \\n\\nThe next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. \\n\\nThe service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol</td>\n",

I told the waiter and when he told his manager about it, she literally ignored it and shooed him away. I am very disappointed in the customer service, seeing as if I was a health inspector, the place would have been shut down immediately. What I experienced could have sent me to the hospital if I had actually swallowed it. I am never ever going back there again, seeing as I want to keep my life.\n",

I only tried their ice cream I really wanted to try the hot chocolate but didn't get a chance :(. Well the ice cream was great! The first night I came here I got a brownie sundae all for myself, brownie on the bottom and three scoops of ice cream topped with whipped cream and nuts. I finished it all happily! I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. \\n\\nThe next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination. \\n\\nThe service was great the workers were really nice and patient with me haha indecisive! They would joke around with me and let me sample all I wanted. Also no judgement for eating all the brownie sundae alone :) lol\n",

It's not great, like some of the upscale pizza places here in the city - but for the burbs, and 8 hungry guys during our weekly poker game night it does the job just fine. And it's not that greasy.

Everyone seemed like they had a great personality. Our waitresses were so attentive and helpful. Shout out to Jackie and Azlin for making it a great date night! The food was amazing. We got the chips and salsa to start. The chips were warm and the warm salsa was so good. I could've drank it. Entrees were the chicken fried chicken for the hubs and the billionaire bacon burger for me. His CFC had a good jalapeño cream gravy, more smokey than spicy. My burger was fabulous. The bacon and pimento cheese made it! The fries were hot and seasoned well. We will be back!\n",

One thing I noticed is that the bathroom scene is mighty intense from time to time, I once witnessed a 10+ men waiting in line for the restroom and at another time I was asked by a lovely, mostly inebriated lady to help her pull her jeans up cause \"they was too tight.\" true story.\n",

I hate giving out 1 star but anyplace that serves 2 separate items from the menu to the table that are inedible deserves it. Food sucks, drinks are wayyy overpriced, outside still looks as sh*tty as it was when it was the Wishing Well. I'm so confused as to why people think they can just put a new bar top in and expect it to succeed. Get a real chef and price drinks according to demographics and neighborhood. How f*cking hard is it to do that people?!\n",

Two nights in a row, I ordered the s'mores sundae (yes, you read that correctly) with Tennesee fudge ice cream!  It was so delicious!  It was crushed graham crackers on the bottom, ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate, chocolate sauce, and candy topping.  Seriously amazing!\\n\\nOver the course of the four days we were there, I got ice cream here five times.  Yes, it was that serious!!\\n\\nI highly recommend anything having to do with this place.

We wanted to sit outside, but they were booked up so they allowed us to sit inside until a table opened outside. We got the truffle fries as an appetizer. Delicious! I got the impossible burger as my entree and the brussel sprouts instead of fries. The burger was so good I thought they accidentally gave me meat. The brussel sprouts tasted as though they were deep fried in grease however. Wasn't a fan. I also got the Lavender Spritz and it was great. I wish I could give this place a 4.5 stars bc the brussel sprouts only took like a .5 off for me. I would definitely recommend!\n",

Second, the hipster cat sugar cookies, (from their Back to School collection,) were both adorable AND incredible. If I could buy them by the dozen, I would. (I'll have to go to Milk and Cookies Bakeshop on the southside to do such a wonderful thing!) \\n\\nWhile there, I dropped a pile of cash on things that I \"needed\" for myself and my cats... cat nip bubbles, a fleece toy, stickers, buttons... Oh boy, I could have purchased even more, but, well, responsibilities.\n",

The shredded beef soup had no beef in it, just onions and leek in a tasty broth. The beef mains was really light on beef as well. Chicken mains wasn't as light but still not that much. It seems like they're trying to keep their prices low by using less meat but I'd rather pay more and enjoy the flavor they bring.\n",

The food portions were perfect to keep one in line with a good healthy meal. bar was refilled and refilled and refilled.\\nAlso the cost wasn't much more than they paid for at a fast establishment like Starbucks.

This was an excellent choice.  The second I tried the strawberry mango margarita.  I enjoyed the strawberry mango but the ladies tried mine and both agreed it was a little too sweet for them.

       "1498  Disappointing food.  \\n\\nCalamari was good - plump and tender.  It was downhill from there.  \\n\\nShrimp cocktail was mushy and a bit \"iffy\" on the freshness.\\n\\nSeared scallops were scorched and had a really bad burnt taste because of it.  \\n\\nLobster roll was terrible.  Way over dressed.  Drowning in a terrible sour, runny mayo sauce.  I think the lobster was frozen, not fresh.  The lobster was diced very small.  I think all the sauce and the small cut were an attempt to cover up that it wasn't good lobster to begin with.\\n\\nMy husband ate only one of his scallops.  I ate only a bite of my lobster roll.  When clearing our plates, the waitress asked if everything was OK.  I explained that I didn't like the lobster roll.  She came back with a complimentary shot glass of pudding as a consolation prize for the terrible dinner.  I politely turned it down.  The check came and included my $22 lobster roll.  A manager never stopped by to ask us about our concerns.  The waitress was very good and attentive other than not taking care of the issue at the end of the meal.\\n\\nWe would not bother to return to this restaurant.\n",

We are new to the Main Line and needed some old locks changed and re-keyed. I called around to comparison shop based on Yelp reviews. Ultimately I landed on AM/PM based on the reviews and the general confidence I had in them after a brief call. Shuy showed up on time and was great. He was honest about what needed to be done, worked with me on the price (there were 9 locks), gave me good advice, and didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. The work was done pretty quickly, he answered all my questions, and was really accommodating when I wanted to modify something after the work had been done. He also was diligent about cleaning things up after the work was done. \\n\\nGreat experience and will definitely hang onto his number and refer him to others. You can't go wrong with them. \\n\\nThanks Shuy!\n",
